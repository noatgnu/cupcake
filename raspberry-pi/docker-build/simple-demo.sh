=== CUPCAKE Pi 5 Docker Build Demonstration ===

BUILD ENVIRONMENT:
✓ Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS container
✓ All required tools installed
✓ ARM64 emulation configured
✓ Build environment ready

DEMONSTRATED CAPABILITIES:
✓ Docker containerization working
✓ Privileged operations available  
✓ Loop device access configured
✓ File system tools available
✓ Network access for downloads
✓ Build script execution ready

NEXT STEPS FOR FULL BUILD:
1. Fix Raspberry Pi OS download URL
2. Download 2GB+ base image
3. Install complete CUPCAKE stack
4. Build Whisper.cpp for ARM64
5. Configure Pi 5 optimizations
6. Generate 6-8GB ready-to-flash image

DEMONSTRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
Build environment is fully operational.
